Compliant mechanisms (CMs), which are normally composed of rigid blocks and flexible members, utilize the elastic deflection of all these built-in flexible members, totransfer motion, force and energy. In the current literature, geometrically nonlinear Euler Bernoulli beam theory and its related methods are commonly used for modelingthese flexible members. However, its governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) only considers the main contributor to beam deflections: bending, without taking careof shear and axial stretch along the beam. To take care of more possible strains, Cosserat rod theory, serves as a better alternative for high accuracy. However, it stillsuffers from relatively complex modeling and time-consuming computation. In this paper, we propose a reduced-mode Cosserat rod model to bypass the need ofconducting complex modeling, providing a more compact formulation. The detailed derivations are presented step by step, and we also propose a mode selectionmethod to meet the requirements of different engineering scenarios. Numerical examples are provided to verify the reduced-mode model as well as the feasibility ofmodeling CMs. In particular, modeling flexible springs and related mechanisms has been proved valid via this proposed model.
