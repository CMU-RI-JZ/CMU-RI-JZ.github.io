Rowing motion with paired propellers is an essential actuation mechanism for swimming robots. Previous work in this field has typically employed flexible propellers to generate a net thrust or torque by using changes in the compliance values of flexible structures under the influence of a fluid. The low stiffness values of the flexible structures restrict the upper limit of the oscillation frequency and amplitude, resulting in slow swimming speeds. Furthermore, complex coupling between the fluid and the propeller reduce the accuracy of flexible propeller simulations. A design of a flexible passive joint paddle was proposed in this study, and a dynamics model and simulation of the paddle were experimentally verified. In order to optimize the straight swimming speed, a data-driven model was proposed to improve the simulation accuracy. The effects of the joint number and controller parameters on the robotâ€™s straight swimming speed were comprehensively investigated. The multi-joint paddle exhibited significantly improved thrust over the single-joint paddle in a symmetric driving mode. The data-driven model reduced the total error of the simulated data of the propulsive force in the range of control parameters to 0.51%. Swimming speed increased by 3.3 times compared to baseline. These findings demonstrate the utility of the proposed dynamics and data-driven models in the multi-objective design of swimming robots.
