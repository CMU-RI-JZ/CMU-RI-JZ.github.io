Hello there! I am Junzhe Hu, a first-year [Master of Science in Robotics (MSR)](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-robotics/) student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am currently working on designing novel variable stiffness mechanisms with real-time feedback control for applications in robot manipulation and locomotion. I am co-advised by [Professor Zachary Manchester](https://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu/) and [Professor Carmel Majidi](http://sml.me.cmu.edu/). Additionally, my work encompasses areas such as optimal control, robot learning, and fluid dynamics.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering and Automation from [Chongqing University](https://english.cqu.edu.cn/) and the [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/) with Cun Laude (Double Degree). My capstone project: "Aerial-Aquatic Robots Capable of Trans-media with Efficient Swimming Propulsion Mode" was selected as the best project in the mechanical department.

Prior to my Bachelorâ€™s. I did a 2023 research internship (Jan-Aug) with Prof. Mohamed Bouri and [Prof. Auke Jan Ijspeert](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/biorob/people/ijspeert/) at [Biorobotics Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/biorob/) in [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), focus medical image segmentation and high precision remote control systems for interventional surgical robots. I also interned at the [Chinese Academy of Science, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology](https://suat-sz.edu.cn/en/) from 2021 to 2022, working on robotic fish and underwater robotics with flexible passive joint paddles, focusing on dynamics modeling of compliant mechanisms in large deformation and CPG control for gait optimization.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, outdoor activities, and traveling.
