Hello there! I am Junzhe Hu, a first-year [Master of Science in Robotics (MSR)](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-robotics/) student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am working on rigid-flexible coupled robot's design and control based on Delta robots.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering and Automation from [Chongqing University](https://english.cqu.edu.cn/) and the [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/) with Cun Laude (Double Degree). My capstone project: "Aerial-Aquatic Robots Capable of Trans-media with 
Efficient Swimming Propulsion Mode" was selected as the best project in the mechanical department.

Prior to my Bachelorâ€™s. I did a 2023 research internship (Jan-Aug) with (Prof. Mohamed Bouri) and [Prof. Auke Jan Ijspeert](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/biorob/people/ijspeert/) at [Biorobotics Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/biorob/) in [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). I also interned at the [Chinese Academy of Science, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology](https://suat-sz.edu.cn/en/) from 2021 to 2022, working on robotic fish and underwater robotics with flexible passive joint paddles, focusing on dynamics modeling of compliant mechanisms in large deformation and CPG control.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, outdoor activities, and traveling.
